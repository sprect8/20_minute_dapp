# Build a Dapp in 20 Minutes

This tutorial will teach you how to build a basic, full-stack Dapp that will connect to a smart contract deployed on a local blockchain instance. 
The goal of this tutorial is to get you familiar with the tools that make up a full-stack Dapp; which includes the blockchain and smart contracts, the deployment tools, and the libraries used to interact with the blockchain.

See index.completed.html in the repository for the completed example.  
See index.base.html for the starting file that this tutorial uses as a base to build the Dapp.

## Components of the Tutorial

Here are the tools we'll use in this tutorial:
1. [Web3 JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.0/) - a javascript library that enables client side applications to talk to blockchain
2. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) - a browser plugin that enables browser to talk to blockchain. This plugin is required because at this point in time most common browsers do not support talking to the blockchain out of the box. 
3. [Ganache](https://docs.harmony.one/home/developers/tools/using-ganache) - local development blockchain to deploy and test your smart contracts for free. Follow the instructions in the page linked in the description to install ganache-cli
4. [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - a web-based smart contract IDE to help deploy your smart contracts onto the blockchain

Install Metamask and Ganache-cli onto your local machine before continuing onto the next section.
